In this project, we will create a model to predict whether someone has a risk at heart disease or not. We use Decision Tree Classifier and train it with dataset from University of California Irvine (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease). This model has an accuracy above 80 %. Later on, we also deploy our model on a cloud computing service called Heroku. You can try our trained model and calculate your risk of getting heart disease here (http://heart-disease-detection-system.herokuapp.com)
